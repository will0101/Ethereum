# Ethereum

I started this journey to learn about the Blockchain and "Web 3.0". There's A LOT of moving pieces involved in understanding this whole eco-system.

Please note, the goal of this is to not make any project in here look "pretty" but to have them work and deployed.

## End Result - not done yet

## [1. My First Smart Contract](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x01147532c241Bf171f7Aa56c17E179dF16050944)

This is nothing too crazy. But, its cool nonetheless.
